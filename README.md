Statistical Machine Learning Kaggle project
# Project overview
This report will demonstrate a systematic process of data pre-processing and classifier model selection based on the given task of Authorship attribution for predicting 800 papers. Each paper has in total of 100 potential prolific authors involved in writing, and the result for each prediction may be zero, one, or many of these authors, namely multi-label classification, imbalanced data handling, and classification model selection, which altogether have brought the team to the Top 10 on Final Kaggle competition.

## Feedback
very insightfull anaylsis, their hyperparameter tuning cuased overfitting from table 3
Very clear and accessible description of all that has been done,a postgraduate student can pick up the report andr ead with no difficulty. section headers number and font confusion
